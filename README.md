# Cortex

> Your second brain, wired up.

Your Obsidian vault is full of ideas — but you can't grep intuition. **Cortex** is a web app that gives your vault a voice. Ask it questions, and it pulls the right notes, threads the connections, and answers with the full weight of everything you've ever written. It doesn't just search — it *understands*.

**RAG-powered chat. Tag browser. Random discovery. One vault that finally talks back.**

## ⚡ What Cortex does differently

Most note apps let you write. Cortex lets you *think*.

| Without Cortex | With Cortex |
|----------------|-------------|
| Searching your vault with Ctrl+F and hope | Ask a question in plain language — Cortex retrieves the right notes and synthesizes an answer |
| Forgetting what you wrote six months ago | Every note is indexed and retrievable by meaning, not just keywords |
| Notes that exist in isolation | A live knowledge graph shows how every idea connects to every other |
| No idea which topics are dense and which are thin | Tag browser and semantic clusters show your vault's regions at a glance |
| Manually reviewing stale notes | Ambient mode surfaces forgotten notes, quotes, stats, and "on this day" flashbacks |
| Never stumbling on old ideas | Discover mode serves random notes — rediscover what you forgot you knew |
| Missing connections you should have made | Link discovery finds notes that are semantically related but not yet linked |

## 🔒 Auth & Security

Cortex is designed to be deployed on the public internet as a personal tool.

- **Single-user setup** — password + TOTP MFA (scan a QR code on first run)
- **JWT sessions** with server-side revocation via Redis, 24h expiry, strict same-site cookies
- **Rate limiting** — Redis-backed INCR+EXPIRE on login and setup endpoints
- **TOTP replay prevention** — atomic set-if-not-exists prevents reuse of one-time codes
- **CSRF protection** — origin validation on all mutating requests
- **Guest mode** — unauthenticated visitors can chat (rate-limited via Haiku), browse tags, discover random notes, and view vault diagnostics (read-only, zero API cost on non-chat routes)
- **Protected routes** — full chat, web search, TTS, sessions, memory, ambient, lineage, digest, graph, clusters, and settings require authentication
- **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- **Edge-compatible token revocation** — middleware checks JWT revocation via Upstash REST API before hitting any route

## ⚙️ Architecture

Cortex runs on **Vercel serverless functions** with all persistent state stored in **Upstash Redis** and embeddings in **Upstash Vector**. A dual-mode abstraction layer (`lib/kv.ts`) falls back to the local filesystem when Redis credentials are absent, so local development works without any cloud services.

### Data flow

```
Local vault (.md files)
        │
        ▼
  npm run sync          ← incremental sync via MD5 hashing
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   ▼         ▼
Upstash    Upstash

   │         │
   └────┬────┘

```

### Dual-mode storage

| Environment | State | Embeddings |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Vercel (production)** | Upstash Redis | Upstash Vector |
| **Local dev** | Filesystem (`.cortex-kv/`) | Upstash Vector (or skip if no key) |

Mode is determined automatically by the presence of `KV_REST_API_URL`.

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cortex
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-...
VAULT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/obsidian-vault

# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
JWT_SECRET=your-random-64-char-hex-string

# Upstash Redis (required for Vercel deployment)
KV_REST_API_URL=https://...upstash.io
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=AX...

# Upstash Vector (required for RAG)
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=https://...upstash.io
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=...

# Optional — required for TTS
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...

# Optional — required for /web search
TAVILY_API_KEY=...
```

For **local development**, `KV_REST_API_URL` can be omitted — Cortex will use the filesystem for state. You still need `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL` and `VOYAGE_API_KEY` for embedding/search features.

### 3. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. First-run enrollment

On first load, Cortex redirects to `/setup`:
1. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
2. Set your password (12+ characters, mixed case, digit, special character)
3. Enter the 6-digit TOTP code to verify enrollment

This is a one-time flow. After setup, you'll log in with password + MFA code.

### 5. Sync your vault

Push your vault content to Upstash Redis and generate embeddings in Upstash Vector:

```bash
npm run sync
```

The sync is **incremental** — it computes MD5 hashes per note and only re-processes changed files. Run it whenever your vault changes, or set up a cron job / CI workflow.

For **local development**, the app reads directly from the filesystem at `VAULT_PATH`, so syncing is only required for the Vercel deployment.

## 🗺 Routes

| Route | Auth | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/` | Guest | Chat — guest mode (vault-backed, ephemeral, rate-limited) or full interface when authenticated |
| `/vault` | Guest | Vault diagnostics and health |
| `/tags` | Guest | Tag browser — explore every tag and its notes |
| `/discover` | Guest | Random note discovery — shuffle through your vault |
| `/notes/new` | Required | Note editor — create new notes with folder picker and tags |
| `/graph` | Required | Interactive knowledge graph |
| `/clusters` | Required | Semantic topic clusters |
| `/ambient` | Required | Ambient display mode |
| `/digest` | Required | AI-generated vault digest |
| `/lineage` | Required | Note reference history |
| `/memory` | Required | Memory management |
| `/settings` | Required | AI personality sliders |
| `/login` | — | Login |
| `/setup` | — | First-run enrollment |

Guest chat (`/api/chat/guest`) uses Claude Haiku, is limited to 500 character inputs, 500 output tokens, 10 messages/hour per IP, and 100 messages/day globally. No session or memory persistence.

Guest exploration routes (vault, tags, discover) are read-only and make zero LLM/embedding API calls.

## 💬 Cortex in action

```
"What have I written about spaced repetition and how does it connect to my productivity notes?"

"Summarize everything I know about systems thinking"

"What connections exist between my notes on stoicism and cognitive behavioral therapy?"

"What am I missing or haven't written about regarding machine learning?"

"Challenge my understanding of free will based on what I've written"

"/web What are the latest developments in retrieval-augmented generation?"

"Create a timeline of everything related to my career transition"

"What notes are related to my thesis outline that I haven't linked yet?"
```

## ☁️ Deploying to Vercel

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Add all environment variables from `.env.local` to your Vercel project settings
4. Deploy — the app uses serverless functions with Edge middleware
5. Run `npm run sync` locally (or in CI) to push vault content to Upstash

The filesystem is read-only on Vercel. All state (sessions, memory, personality, auth config, lineage) is stored in Upstash Redis. Vault content and embeddings are pushed via `npm run sync`.
